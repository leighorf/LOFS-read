In order to build the cm1hdf5 plugin, part of LOFS, you must:

1. Install visit (or, if you are on Blue Waters, module load visit)
2. Create an appropriate xml file for xml2cmake [see "Getting Your Data into VisIt"]
3. run: xml2cmake -clobber your_file.xml
4. run: cmake . 
5. run: make

If you make it through all of that, your shared library database plugins
and associated directories will install in $HOME/.visit/VERSION

Note, LOFS requires ZFP compression, which must be built into HDF5.
